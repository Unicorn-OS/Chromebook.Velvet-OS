# Summary:
>the third reason why this might be interesting is if one wants to run linux on a laptop with an arm processor and not an intel one. there are only a few laptops easily available with arm cpus which can be used with linux: the pinebook pro comes into mind or maybe some of those windows laptops with arm cpus - the first (while being a very nice option in general with a very vivid community around it) is quite limited performance wise (old rk3399 soc), does not have the best build quality (strange noise from the speakers for instance) and is sometimes not easy to get - the latter, while promising quite a good performance, are still very complicated to setup and usually are not really available in the lower price ranges. here the newer 64bit arm chromebooks fit in quite nicely, as they usally have relatively modern hardware, good build quality and are easily available at rather low prices (even more if one gets them used and there seems to be a large used market for them): the mediatek mt8173 ones are quite well supported, have a performance similar to that of the pinebook pro, but there is no support for opengl acceleration via its (powervr) gpu yet (but there is some work in progress for that) - the mediatek mt8183 (kompanio 500) ones have better performance and better energy efficiency than the pinebook pro, the gpu is supported by the open source panfrost driver in mesa and they are quite well supported meanwhile - the snapdragon 7180c ones are maybe slightly faster than the mt8183 ones (but not that much), they have a well suppored gpu (via the open source freedreno mesa driver), but they are still a bit of work in progress in some areas and some of their hardware seems to require quite a mess of binary blobs to work - and there are the rockchip rk3399 based ones, which use the same soc as the pinebook pro - they are quite well supported (including the gpu via the open source panfrost mesa driver) and usually have a very good build quality. the latest and newer mediatek mt8192 (kompanio 8xx) and mt8195 (kompanio 13xx) based chromebooks are currently being mainlined in the linux kernel and should see some starting useable mainline linux support during 2023 most probably as a result.
